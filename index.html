          <b><h2 style="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville'; padding-left: 10%;">Introduction:</h2></b>
          <p style="padding-left: 10%; font-family: 'Libre Baskerville'; font-weight: lighter">
            A large issue in our modern-day world is the threat of running out of non-renewable energy sources. Our team discussed from a wide variety of topics, including using ducklings as power.
        We first needed to derive how much power a single duckling can generate so that we could expand on it. We chose the American Pekin as our
    duck of choice, since it's the first that comes to mind when you hear the word "baby duck", yellow, and doesnt have a lot of feathers. Baby American Pekins on average are about
1.5kg, so we used that as a starting number. Since babies can't pull very much of their weight, we settled on 7%. This gave us a pulling weight of<br> 0.105 kg.
using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99k-EAMBuM8">this source, </a>we concluded that a duck can on average travel at a human's walking speed if they're happy or want something. Since the average<br>
 walking speed of a human is 1.4m/s, we used that number as the average speed a duck will pull the weight at. Computing this number, we get 1.4 * 0.105, which<br>
  equals 0.147 m-kg/s. After multiplying this number by Earth's gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s^2), we arrive at the power of a duck, which is approximatley 1.44 watts.
After reaching this number, we realized that we could power multiple household electronics using solely duckling power, provided we had enough ducklings.
There was an idea of free energy lingering under it, and it hit us after a minute. The ducklings would stop because they got hot & tired from powering the elctronics.
We sugguested that they power a refrigerator to cool down and rest in. Assuming the average household refrigerator uses 180 watts, we would need 180 / 1.44 = 125 ducklings to power the fridge.
We would be able to attach extra ducklings to a generator to generate electricity for the house. Whenever those ducklings got hot, we could put them in the fridge to rest & cool, and take other ducklings out. It would be a repeating cycle.
We soon realized that ducklings could also be used to power other stuff than electrical generators. The conversion from duckpower to horsepower was very simple since we already had our number in watts. 1 horsepower (HP)<br>
is defined as approximatley 746 watt seconds. To convert from ducklingpower to horsepower, we divided 1.44 by 746, arriving that 1 ducklingpower is approximatley 1/500th of a horsepower.
We wanted to know how many ducks it would take to equal the same power as a current (2020) Chrysler Minivan. The data sheet says it has 287 horsepower.
Multiplying 500 by 287, we arrive at a number of 143,500 ducklings required to match the power of a new Chrysler Minivan.
</p>
<b><h2 style="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville'; padding-left: 10%;">Conclusion:</h2></b>
<p style="padding-left: 10%; font-family: 'Libre Baskerville'; font-weight: lighter">
    While duckling power may be extremely small and therefore useless for powering stuff with a lot of horsepower, such as a minivan, we found
    them useful in the fact that they can create free energy as long as they keep a fridge running.
